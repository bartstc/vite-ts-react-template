# Guideline

## How to use

_You may simply download a ZIP Directory and start with a clean git repository using a command_ `git init`...

... or clone this repo through git CLI.

```
git clone -b basic --depth 1 --single-branch https://github.com/bartstc/spa-vite-template.git [project_name]
```

```
git clone -b core --depth 1 --single-branch https://github.com/bartstc/spa-vite-template.git [project_name]
```

Link cloned repo with your own remote repository.

```
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/project.git
```

Create and push your own branch designated for development.

```
git checkout -b [branch_name]
```

```
git push --set-upstream origin [branch_name]
```

Set your newly created and pushed branch as default. You may do this in `Settings` -> `Branches` -> `Default Branch`.
